--

 - It's the same exact interface on all the OS it can run
 
--

 - It is an excellent plot device

--

 - It is convenient for managing packages, view and interact with any objects stored in the environment or system files

# Why RStudio?

<br>

 - easily integrate with version control software like *git* and *GitHub*

--

 - provide additional tools like terminal, database connections, background jobs, addins

--

 - some *R* more advanced components, like *Shiny* and *RMarkdown*, work only with *RStudio*

--

 - last but not least, like *R*, it is free and open-source (but there are commercial versions)

# Why Version Control?

 - it's a Single Source of Truth

--

 - keep track of what you have been doing retrospectively, providing functionalities for restoring previous versions

--

 - force you to describe what you've done

--

 - much easier collaboration with others

--

 - a proof of hard work to your advisor

--

 - *why GitHub?* community, sharing, sort of backup


---
# *R* Quick Facts

 - Commands don't need to be terminated with any special character
 
--

 - R is case-sensitive 

--

 - Multiple spaces and tabs don't matter

--

 - Comments are only one-liner and are identified by the hash sign `#`

--

 - When referring to paths, backslashes `\` are not admitted
   In Windows, it's possible to use a double backslash `\\` instead

---
# *R* Quick Facts

 - Typing the name of any object will display a printed representation

--

 - Alternatively, the `print()` function can be used to display the entire object

--

 - Element numbers are displayed in square brackets on the left of the output
 
--

 - Function calls require always parentheses, even if there are no arguments

--

 - Typing a function‚Äôs name will display its definition and arguments list (often not very enlightening)


---
# Help

 - `help(topic)` or `?topic` for a specific help on an existing object or function 

--

 - `vignette(topic)` for an existing detailed help, or even tutorial, on a specific package
 
--

 - `??topic` search the help system for a generic topic

--

 - `help.start()` open a browser pointing to a variety of (locally stored) information about R


---
# Help Online

 - [Google]() add *r* or *rstats* to your search

 - [Stack Overflow]() add ‚Äú[r]‚Äù to your search

 - [rseek.org]() (Google, but focused on R)

 - [Quick R]() - statmethods.net


---
# Packages

 - An *R* package is an extension of the *R* language that consists of a related set of functions, documentation, and data files, that are bundled together to solve specific questions or more generic problems

--

 - *R* comes with standard packages, which contain the basic functions and data sets as well as standard statistical and graphical functions that allow R to work


---
# Packages

Most packages are available through the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/PACKAGES.html) or *CRAN*. 

--

Other repositories for *R* packages are:
 - [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/)
 - [Github](https://github.com/)
 - [R-Forge](http://r-forge.r-project.org/)

--

Each of the above sources require its own way for installing packages


---
# Packages

 - you need to *install* any package before being able to use it. It is a one-off operation

--

 - `install.packages(pkgname)` to install packages from *CRAN* 

--

 - `devtools::install_github('author/repo')` to install packages from *Github* 


---
# Packages

 - `library(pkgname)` load the package *pkgname* in the system. You need to do this every time you want to use the package

--

 - `require(pkgname)` same as *library* but made to be used inside functions, as it outputs a warning and continues if the package is not found, while *library* throws an error

--

 - `pkgname::funname` call the function *funname* contained in the package *pkgname* without loading the entire package in the system

---
# Packages

 - `library(pkgname, lib.loc = 'path')` to load the package from a particular location

--

 - `library()` lists all the packages installed in the system

--

 - `library(help = pkgname)` shows a brief description of the package *pkgname* 

---
# Tidyverse

 - It's a collection of *R* packages built around the basic concept of *tidy data*
 
--

   - data in a table should have one observation per row, one variable per column, and only one value per cell.

--

 - Provides an efficient, fast, and well-documented workflow for general data modeling, wrangling, and visualization tasks

--

 - Introduces a set of useful data analysis packages to help streamline your work in *R*
 
---
# Tidyverse

In particular, the Tidyverse was designed to address the top three common issues that arise when dealing with data analysis in R functions:

 - Results obtained from a base *R* function often depend on the type of data being used
 
--

 - When *R* expressions are used in a non-standard way, they can confuse beginners
 
--
 
 - Hidden arguments often have various default operations that beginners are unaware of
 
---
# Environment

 - `search()` returns the list of all the attached packages, in decreasing order of their loading time, starting from `.GlobalEnv` and ending with `base`, first to be loaded and always required
 
--

 - `searchpaths()` returns the paths of the attached packages, in the same order as `search`

--

 - `ls()` or `objects()` list the names of all the objects open in the current environment

--

 - `ls(pos = n)` or `objects(pos = n)`  list of the names of all the objects

---
# Environment

 - `ls.str()` for a detailed list of the objects 

--

 - `rm(x)` function to remove the object called `x`

--

 - `rm(list = ls())` to remove all the objects from the current environment


---
# Environment

 - When starting, *R* looks for a file called `.RData` in the current directory. If it doesn‚Äôt exist it creates it.

--

 - The `.RData` file stores the content of the current workspace

--

 - Any directory can then become the reference of a different *project*

--

 - `save.image()` to save your current data whenever and wherever you want

---
# Environment

 - `getwd()` retrieve the current *working directory*

--

 - `setwd(x)` to change the working directory


---
# Objects

 - Objects can be assigned values using either an equal sign `=` or the special `<-` operator
 
--

 - In automation, it's more convenient to use the function `assign('varname', value)`
 
--
 
 - In any assignment statements, *R* actually copy the object, it is not passed by reference.
 
--
 
 - If you don‚Äôt assign the result of an expression to an object, *R* will display the results, but also store it in the `.Last.value` object
 
--

 - The `str()` function shows the structure of an object
 
---
# Data Types

 - *character* any set of characters enclosed in single or double quotes

--

 - *logical* `TRUE` or `FALSE`

--

 - *numeric* any number, that can also be *integer* or *double*

--

 - *Date* standard form is 'YYYY-MM-DD'

--

 - *POSIXct* (*c*alendar *t*ime) stores the number of seconds since the origin
 - *POSIXlt* (*l*ocal *t*ime) keeps the date as a list of time attributes (such as "hour" and "mon")

---
# Data Types

 - `is.*(x)` to test if the object `x` is of the specified type

--

 - `as.*(x)` convert, if possible, `x` into the specified type
 
--

 - `class(x)`, `mode(x)`, `typeof(x)` all describe the data type of the object `x`

---
# Data Structures: Vector

 - Set of elements of the same type. You can have numeric vectors, character vectors, logical vectors. But you can't mix and match. 

--

 - Use the function `c()` to create small vectors by hand

--

 - Square brackets `[ ]` are used for indexing and subsetting

---
# Data Structures: Vectors
 - Most operators are *vectorized*, ie. are applied to all elements in parallel

--

 - If an operation is applied to vectors of different lengths, the elements in the shorter vector(s) are *recycled* until the lengths of all involved objects are the same


---
# Data Structures: Sequences (Vectors)

 - `start:end`
 
 - `seq(start, end, by)` where `by` means the difference between each component
 
 - `seq(start, end, length)` where `length` means the number of component

 - `rep(x, times)` repeat `x` `times` times

 - `rep(x, each)` repeat each component `each` times

 - `rep(x, len)` recycle `x` until reach a sequence of `len` components

---
# Finding Elements

 - `which(condition)`

 - `which.min(condition)`

 - `which.max(condition)`

The above functions all returns the index or indices of the elements satisfying the request

---
# Ordering

 - `sort(x, )`


---
# Duplicated Values

 `duplicated(x)`

 - Determines which elements are duplicates of elements with smaller subscripts
 - Returns a logical vector indicating which elements (rows) are duplicates.
 - `x <- x[!duplicated(x)]` to delete duplications

 - insert `fromLast` to 
 - insert `nmax = n` to return TRUE only for duplication at least as `n`

---
# Data Structures: Matrix

 - a vector with a non-null dimension attribute `dim(x) <- c(nrow, ncol)`

 - 

 - matrix operations are also vectorized

---
# Data Structures: Dataframe

 - A set of vectors of the same length. The most useful way to represent tabular data in *R*

--

 - The columns (variables) of a dataframe can be of different types, but they all must contain the same number of elements

--

 - The top line of the table, called the header, contains the column names
 
--

 - To retrieve data in a cell, we would enter its row and column coordinates in the single square bracket "[]" operator. The two coordinates are separated by a comma. In other words, the coordinates begins with row position, then followed by a comma, and ends with the column position.
 
--

- The function data.frame() creates data frames

---
# Data Structures: List

 - a *list* provides a very general way to hold a collection of, possibly named, arbitrary R objects. 

--

 - to extract an element corresponding to an item in a list we use the double bracket notation `[[ ]]`

--

 - if the items of the list are named, it's possible to use the more common `$` notation

---
# Factors

 - a convenient representation for columns of a dataframe that represents *categorical* variable, with a number of finite labels with no direct numrical meaning

--

 - the set of unique different values that a factor can assume are called *levels*
 
--

 - the levels can be ordered or not
 
--

 - they are practical in models as they can be *expanded* automatically


---
